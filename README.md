# 🧠 Building and Training Neural Networks for Image Classification

This repository demonstrates how to **build, train, and evaluate neural networks** for solving image classification tasks. The project walks through dataset preprocessing, neural network architecture design, model training, and performance evaluation.

It’s designed for learners and practitioners who want to understand the **foundations of deep learning-based image classification** before moving on to more advanced models like CNNs or Transformers.

## 🚀 Features

* Step-by-step implementation of **image classification pipelines**.
* Multiple architectures:

  * Simple **Dense Neural Networks (DNNs)**
  * Baseline **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** (optional extension)
* Dataset support: **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, **CIFAR-10** (configurable).
* Training visualization with **loss/accuracy curves**.
* Evaluation with **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**.
* Modular code structure for easy experimentation.
